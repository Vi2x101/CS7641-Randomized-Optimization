Assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization

Code can be accessed at this Github repository: https://github.com/Vi2x101/CS7641-Randomized-Optimization.git

Or through Box: https://gatech.box.com/s/d4g8y7suibnn9xuglquno7s5nz6fg0j6

Before running any code, it is advised to download any packages needed using requirements.txt.

The nn_weights_optimization folder contains the code and plots used in comparing RO algorithms against backpropagation on a dataset from A1. The optimization_problems folder contains the code for each individual problem: Flip Flop, Continous Peaks, and Four Peaks. There is a plots folder containing images of the plots
